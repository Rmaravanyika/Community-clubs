Variables
==============


Variables act as a placeholder for whatever you place in them, and, can be
changed.So they are... you guessed it... VARIABLE!Below are a few examples of variables.
A variable can take any name without a space between them.Normally l name my variables as
``variableExample`` or i do it like this ``variable_example``
feel free to use a way that is convenient for you.

.. code-block:: python

    exampleVar = 100
    print(exampleVar)

    #cannotDo = Hey! of cause this doesn't work



    canDo = 'Hey!'
    print(canDo)

    canContainOperations = 5/4
    print(canContainOperations) 

In short this is what is meant by variables, be sure to remember what a variable is because we
will continuously ref to them.i think, l can safely say in all python projects there is always a
variable.Fell free to play around with variables as they can be useful.
