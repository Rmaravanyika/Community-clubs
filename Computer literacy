Introduction to Computers and programming

Computers are general purpose, programmable devices that are capable of calculating and storing results.
They can be used for typing, desktop publishing, sound editing, video editing, accounts, email, internet browsing and
technical drawing – just to name a few. They are used in businesses, government, education, entertainment, health care, 
sport, art and design, homes, clubs, restaurants, libraries, car engines, bank automatic teller machines, supermarket checkouts,
washing machines, telephone systems, video recorders and watches. All computer information is stored in digital format. This format
is binary code which consists only of 0s and 1s – on and off. Everything input into the computer is converted into binary code and 
likewise, in order to output the information into its original state, the binary code must converted back again.

Programming is basically giving a computer a set of instructions to execute or perform.Computers have their own specific language different 
from that humans use.Computer instructions are interpreted as 0/1.So for humans to tell computers what to do they have to write certain 
languages.These languages are called programming languages examples of programming languages included python,php,java script,c,html,css etc
But for us to understand programming languages we have to understand how the computers works.So lets jump straight into it.

A computer is splited into two sections the hardware and the software.The hardware is the physical part we can see with our own eyes that 
part we can actually touch.The software is the part of a computer that we can not see with our eyes but we that see what it is doing
The software is formed pr is made using the programming languages the i hav ementioned above.

Hardware
=========

Hardware consists of the physical components of a computer system, which include peripheral equipment – equipment outside of the
tower case – such as printers, modems, scanners, monitors, keyboards and mouse devices. The 3 essential peripherals include the
monitor (output), keyboard and mouse (input). Hardware is broken up into four categories: input, output, storage and processing.

Software
==========

There are 2 types of software: The Operating System (OS), and Application Software. The OS on these machines is Microsoft Windows.
We will look at Windows later in the notes. Application Software consists of programs or sets of instructions that cause the computer 
system to behave in a given way. E.g. Microsoft Word - Word Processing Software; Microsoft Excel - Spreadsheet Software;
Microsoft PowerPoint - Presentation Software; Internet Explorer - Internet Browsing Software. These you will find by clicking on the
Start button with your mouse and then clicking on Programs.

i think you are now familiar with the basic stuff about computers.You can go on and do more research about who create a computer and why
they created it.Right now we are going to actually interact with our computers that are sitting infront of you.i hope you are excited as
i am.Computers are very fun to use because you can do a lot of staff with them(don't worry you will all soon be familiar with what they do)

We will start by naming all the hardware component of the computer and highlight how they work.This is the Central Processing Unit 
known as the CPU,it is the brain of the computer,it perform all major functions of the computer.The second component we are going to
is the monitor, the monitor works as the interaction point between the computer and the user.Another important component of the computer
is the keyboard;it allows us to put inputs into the computer.We are going to learn a bit more about the Keyboard.

Keyboard
=========

Caps Lock Key
=============
The caps lock key activates a feature that affects only the letter keys. Pressing on the caps lock button causes all letter 
keys to type in uppercase. All other keys will act the same as if caps lock is off. To deactivate caps lock, press the caps lock
key again. 

Shift Key
==========
The shift key is used in combination with a second key. The shift key is used primarily to capitalize letters.
Shift differs from caps lock because you have to hold the shift key down while simultaneously pressing another key to 
capitalize a letter, where you only press the caps lock key once. Holding down the shift key also is used to type the characters
and symbols above the numbers on the number keys. 

Tab Key
========

The tab key is used to move from one position on the screen to another. It also creates a “tab stop” (right 1/2 inch)
indentation for your paragraphs. This is very similar to a typewriter. 
 
Enter Key
===========

When working with text (words), pressing on the enter key moves the cursor down to the next line. Otherwise,
pressing the enter key will activate anything that you have selected. 
 
Escape Key
===========

The escape key is used to cancel the current operation or can be used to exit a program.

Spacebar
==========

Pressing the space bar while the cursor is positioned within text will cause a space (one character wide) to be placed
at the position of the cursor.

Control Key
============

The control key (Ctrl) is usually used with another key. Holding the control key in addition to another key or keys will
start a function. Later on, we will teach you some control key functions that deal with word processing. 

Alt Key 
========
The alternate key (Alt), similar to the control key, and is used in combination with other keys.

Arrow Keys
===========

The four arrow keys are located on several keys to the right of the spacebar at the bottom of the keyboard.
Pressing one of these keys will cause some type of screen movement in the direction of the arrow on the key.
These keys are frequently used when correcting mistakes in documents and allow users to “go back” and fix mistakes
instead of erasing all of the work since the mistake was made. 

Backspace Key
=============

Pressing the backspace key while the cursor is positioned within text will delete the character (or space) immediately to 
the left of the cursor. 

Delete Key
===========

Pressing the delete key while the cursor is positioned within text will delete the character (or space) immediately to the right
of the cursor.

The mouse
============

Another component of the computer is the mouse the mouse allows us to move the mouse from point A to B.It also allows us to select 
thing buy clicking on the item.Clicking just means presssing the button on the mouse.Lets look into detail of how a mouse works.

Using a mouse
==============

1.	Let your hand rest comfortably on top of the mouse. Most people are righthanded and therefore, the mouse is usually on the
right side of the computer. All left-handed folks don’t have to worry because millions of “lefties” use computers. Some lefthanded
people simply move the mouse over to their left side of the computer and use it there. Others use their right hand and soon become 
ambidextrous! It’s most important to remember to “do what’s most comfortable for you!” For teaching purposes, we will now continue using
the right hand terminology.

2.	Fit the palm of your hand around the mouse, with your index finger resting on the left (the primary) mouse button and your
middle finger resting on the right (the secondary) mouse button. Let the heel of your hand rest on the desk or table.

3.	As you move the mouse, the mouse pointer (the cursor on the screen) will move in the same direction as your hand.

That about effort about the hardware of a computer, let now move to the software part of the computer.We are going to use a windows 7
operating system but they are other operating systems such as linux and also Mac OS.In this section we are going to cover only windows
operating system.

Operating system
===================

An operating system allows the hardware and the software to communicate. It also provides a platform from which to run programs
and manage our documents and files that we save. Windows has been specially designed to allow us to run more than one program at
a time. This is called multi-tasking. Each space that a program occupies on the screen is called a Window. We can actually view more
than one open program on our screens by resizing these Windows. Alternatively, we can simply go from one open program to another by 
selecting the program on the taskbar – the bar at the bottom of the screen.

The desktop
============
When you have logged on to the computer, you will see a number of small pictures, called icons, on the screen in front of you. 
When the screen looks like this, it is called the “Desktop”. Let’s look at a couple of these icons. They are shortcuts to other 
items.

My computer
============

Close, Restore, Maximize and Minimize Buttons In the top right-hand corner you will see the Close, Restore and Minimize buttons. 
This is common to every program you will be using. Maximise: To make the window fill the whole screen, click on . Restore: To make
the window smaller again, click on . Minimise: To make the window disappear without closing it – it will still be available in the
taskbar – click on . To undo this, click on the button “My Computer” in your taskbar. Close: To close the window, one would click on 
. (Do not close this window now!)

Resizing windows
It is also possible to resize windows by clicking and dragging. Let’s take a look. By positioning the cursor over the edge of
the “My Computer” window, a double arrow appears. Click down on the mouse button, holding it down, and move your mouse. You will 
notice that you are dragging the edge of the window. Release the mouse button when you are happy with the size of the window. 
You can click and drag one of the sides of a window, or a corner of a window. 

Moving windows
Windows can be moved by clicking and dragging on the title bar of the window. The title bar is the blue bar at the top of the window
that tells us what the window is called and what it is for.

Start menu
To use the start menu to open programs:
1. Point and click the mouse pointer at the button at the lower left corner of the Windows desktop 
(the screen that appears when you first start up your computer). 

This activates a pop-up menu. 
2. Slide the mouse pointer up the menu to Programs. The menu selection will be highlighted in blue and a sub-menu will be activated.
3. Slide the mouse pointer straight to the right onto the sub-menu.
4. Slide the pointer straight up or down to highlight the program group that you would like to use and then click on the program you want to open

Turning ON a computer
On a desktop computer, there will be a button to turn on the computer. Similarly, there will usually be a button on the monitor to 
turn on the monitor. These buttons are usually on the front of the computer and the monitor. The computer goes through a number of
internal tasks when starting up. It may take a few minutes for it to complete these tasks. Patience, as you will learn, is used a 
lot when working with a computer. After the computer stops making what almost sounds like a grinding noise (this is normal – it’s 
the hard drive being accessed) and the picture on the screen stops changing, it is probably ready for you to use! Turning a computer
off takes more practice. You should follow the procedure below that allows the computer to properly store files. Avoid unplugging 
the computer or holding down the power button, unless the computer freezes.

1. Click on the start button at the bottom left of the screen. 
2. From the start menu choose Shut down. 
3. In the dialog box that opens, select Shut down (if it isn't already pre-selected). 
4. Click on the OK button. 
5. Wait until the monitor turns black and the computer is no longer making a humming noise. Lastly, turn off the computer monitor by pressing the power button on the

 Section B
 ===========
 
 In this section we are going to learn about programming and also the internet and how it works.But first most of you are wondering how 
 programming will benefit you in terms of the career path way.I think l can safely safe that progranning is the only field where you can 
 two part ways to a career.l will explain what i mean by that,you can be a doctor and also an programmer/developer.You can also be an
 engineer while you are programmer.So to me thats so awesome hey.It means you can increase your chances of getting a job.l will just
 name a few careers you can take with python programming language,but i want you to go ahead and research more about it at your own time
  
  http://prezi.com/o0flzhokvuko/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share 
  
  here is one link you can follow for programming careers.
  
  Moving on right along,we are going to learn about one of the most fasinating platforms wish is the command prompt.LEt open it and see how it
  looks like.Here is how you can open your command prompt.
  
1.	Go to the start menu
2.	Click on all programs
3.	Click on accessories
4.	Click on Command prompt

A little black box should pop up on the window.This black screen is called the command prompt and usually it is 
used by programmers to write instructions to the computer.The interesting part is that i always see that blck screen on movies,
which is so cool according to me at least.The command prompt always make me happy.l feel like i am on top on the world.AWESOMENESS, will
be our middle name, just kidding,moving on right along.

Most of the stuff to follow was from the djangogirls tutorial: Thank Djangogirls

What is the command line?
The window, which is usually called the command line or command-line interface, is a
text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. Much
like Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for
the command line are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal

First command

> whoami

And then hit enter . This is our result:

Basics
Each operating system has a slightly different set of commands for the command line, so
make sure to follow instructions for your operating system. Let's try this, shall we?

Current directory
It'd be nice to know where are we now, right? Let's see. Type this command and hit enter :

If you're on Windows:
> cd
C:\Users\olasitarska
You'll probably see something similar on your machine. Once you open the command line
you usually start at your user's home directory.
Note: 'pwd' stands for 'print working directory'.
List files and directories
So what's in it? It'd be cool to find out. Let's see:

Windows:
> dir
Directory of C:\Users\olasitarska
05/08/2014 07:28 PM <DIR> Applications
05/08/2014 07:28 PM <DIR> Desktop
05/08/2014 07:28 PM <DIR> Downloads
05/08/2014 07:28 PM <DIR> Music
...
Change current directory
Now, let's go to our Desktop directory:

Windows:
> cd Desktop
Windows:
> cd
C:\Users\olasitarska\Desktop
Here it is!
PRO tip: if you type cd D and then hit tab on your keyboard, the command line will
automatically autofill the rest of the name so you can navigate faster. If there is more
than one folder starting with "D", hit the tab button twice to get a list of options.
Create directory
How about creating a practice directory on your desktop? You can do it this way:

Windows:
> mkdir practice
This little command will create a folder with the name practice on your desktop. You can
check if it's there just by looking on your Desktop or by running a ls or dir command! Try

it :)
PRO tip: If you don't want to type the same commands over and over, try pressing the
up arrow and down arrow on your keyboard to cycle through recently used
commands.

Exercise!
Small challenge for you: in your newly created practice directory create a directory called
test . Use cd and mkdir commands.

Windows:
> cd practice
> mkdir test
> dir
05/08/2014 07:28 PM <DIR> test
Congrats! :)

Clean up
We don't want to leave a mess, so let's remove everything we did until that point.
First, we need to get back to Desktop:

Windows:
> cd ..
Using .. with the cd command will change your current directory to the parent directory
(this is the directory that contains your current directory).
Check where you are:


Windows:
> cd
C:\Users\olasitarska\Desktop
Now time to delete the practice directory:
Attention: Deleting files using del , rmdir or rm is irrecoverable, meaning deleted
files will be gone forever! So, be very careful with this command.

Windows:
> rmdir /S practice
practice, Are you sure <Y/N>? Y
Done! To be sure it's actually deleted, let's check it:

Windows:
> dir

Exit

That's it for now! You can safely close the command line now. Let's do it the hacker way,
alright?:)

Windows:
> exit
Cool, huh?:)

I really think that this is so so cool.You now know a few commands in the command prompt.But there is still more to come
Don't try to memories the commands at once just like you did you multiplication table NO.Just refer to the commands when you need them
you will realise that you will get to a point where you don't refer anymore.So don't be too scared.Anywhere moving on right along....

Introduction to programming

LEt me introduce you to the programming language that we are going to learn.Don't be scare of the word python.It was just a name given
to the programming language by the person who started it.Itz a crazy name tho isn't it,but you will get used to the word.

=================================================================================================================================
MOst of our python language sythax comes from one of our generous friends in USA "Kinsley Harrison" and we are using his stuff to 
learn the python sythax.So don't forget to say thank you.If you can you can also support him through donations.Thank you so much

Python 3 Programming Introduction Tutorial (We’ll be using the tutorial off of Python’s website) 
Chances are, if you're viewing this page, you're brand new to Python.
You might even be new to Programming all-together. Either way, you have come to the right place, and chosen the right language!

Why Python?
Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be
understood even if you do not know any programming. Let me show you:
Garage = "Ferrari", "Honda", "Porsche", "Toyota"
	  
for each_car in Garage:
	print(each_car)
	  
"print()" is a built-in Python function that will output some text to the console.
When someone says to "print to the console," they are referring to where information from your program is ouput. This might be a 
command prompt (CMD.exe), the terminal for Mac/Linux users, or the interactive prompt in IDLE. You will see an example of "output 
to console" below.

Looking at the code about cars in the garage, can you guess what will happen? You probably have a general idea. For each_car in the
garage, we're going to do something. What are we doing? We are printing each car.
Since "printing" outputs some text to the "console," you can probably figure out that the console will say something like 
"Ferrari, Honda, Porsche, Toyota."

What can Python do?

Python is a fully-functional programming language that can do anything almost any other language can do, at comprable speeds.

Python is capable of threading and GPU processing just like any other language. Most of the data processing modules are actually
just Python wrappers around C/C++ code.

"Modules" are pre-written Python code that you "import" in your Python program. Since there are many tasks that people commonly do,
we have modules that people have written that do these taks for you, and they usually do them in the cleanest and most efficient
method possible. Sometimes you will see people refer to "DRY." This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, which often also translates
into "Don't Repeat Someone Else."

The phrase "wrapper" means that someone has placed, like a wrapper, Python code over another language. So, when you have a Python 
wrapper around C++ code, what someone has done is written some Python code that interacts with the C++ language. This allows you to
make use of various aspects of the language being wrapped, in this case C++, without actually needing to know or understand that
language.

Thus, Python can be used to make games, do data analysis, control robot and hardware, create GUIs, or even to create websites.
"GUI" stands for Graphical User Interface, and is used to describe a program that incorporates graphics to make the program more 
interactive for the user.
