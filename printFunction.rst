Print function
================

The print function is basically used for debugging processes.This use is basically to debugg stuff.You can use it to solve your errors.Otherwise in actual production it doesn't work that often.

.. code-block:: python

    print('This is an example of the print function')
    
    # while we are here, let's talk a bit about strings #
    
    print("double quotes")
    
    print('or single...')
    
    print('concatena'+'tion')
    
    print('can do this',5)
    #print('cannot do this:'+5)
    
    #print('Can't do this')
    print('you\'ll have success here')
    print("you'll have success here too")
      



These are just the basics of strings for now, you can also pass
variables and do all sorts of neat things. As always feel free to try things out and experiment on things just too much.
