Developing ZimboPy Curriculum 
=============================

If you want to help develop the curriculum there is a great need and your efforts are
welcome!Basically for this curriculum we want to develop the basic python sythanx that can be use with someone who doesn't have any experience with programming what so ever.
We are developing it for use with people that have never used internet or ever a computer before.After we are done with that we want to move to the application aspects of python programming.We are going to be focusing mainly on 3 sections that are Web development,Mobile application development,Data manipulation,Robotics and game development.

To assist in development, you can help in a number of ways as highlight above.




Web development
================

We are using Django as the framework for web development.The documentation should be more of a tutorial rather than a lecture.We are just adding it to this repo, so you can just create a new file and name it ``Web_development.rst``.We are using *reStructuredText* as a markup language, See a live demo at  http://rst.ninjs.org/ .Below are a few guidelines one can use we it comes to the tutorial.


What should it look like?
----------------------------

We want to create a simple and light weight social platform or a blog.On this platform we have users.Users should be able to post (tweets) and other users can follow them and comment.We will also have a backend section where we have a list of users,their joining date and email address.Try to keep it simple (beginners stuff).


Installation
-------------
- You have to start we the installation of any packages that are required in your to tutorial.
- Also include how the packages are installed 
- Quickly highlight common errors that are found during the installation
- highlight installation for linux,window and Mac Os
- Cover how to install packages offline
- commands to create a virtualenv


Github and deployment
---------------------

This part should start with a brief explaination of what is hosting and why we do it.The explain what is github and why we use it.The explain pythonanywhere and how one can get to know about it.Step by step creating of a github account,creation of a repo,basic github commands eg ``git status``.Step by step creation of a pythonanywhere account and how to use it.Pushing and pulling code to pythonanywhere and setting up the virtualenv on python anywhere upto deployment.





FrontEnd development(basic CSS and HTML)
----------------------------------------

how to change color,how to add background,colors and images.Just a basic frontend development always keeping in mind its for beginners.




Finish it with some tips of creating a bigger site
---------------------------------------------------
This involves how to change databases and also how to customize django admin.
You can included any other tip you think it is usefull for actual production.


*Feel free to ask if you need clarity on anything.Looking forward to here from you.To do that just raise an issue and we will respond as soon as we can.Cool!!!!!*



Mobile development
===================

We are going to be using Kivy as the framework.We want to make a tutorial for that cater for begginers and people who are completely new to Kivy and its development.We are going to be creating a very simple mobile application and upload it to an android phone.


What to include.
------------------

We want a simple kivy application that display a motivational message at random.The application should ask for one's name and when the enter the message it will right the name of the person as part of the motivational message for **example:** " *Ronald* you are an awesome programmer".In that example the name is *Ronald* and it has been included in the motivation messgae


Installation
-------------

- You have to start we the installation of any packages that are required in your to tutorial.
- Also include how the packages are installed 
- Quickly highlight common errors that are found during the installation
- highlight installation for linux,window and Mac Os
- Cover how to install packages offline
- commands to create a virtualenv

Uploading to a phone
--------------------
You should cover how to upload the application on an android phone.Public deployment should be covered also in this section,include how the applicationa can be published.

Errors
--------

Always try to cover the common errors that will be encountered during the installation or publishment on the site and how best one can solve those errors

Robotics
==========

We are going to be using a raspberry pi for this section.We don't have a particular model that we are working with.If you want to contribute to this just raise an ``issue`` and we will get back to you as soon as possible.To really specially the details for this section.




Data Science/Data Manipulation and processing
==============================================

if you want to contribute to this section raise and issue which gives a brief of what you want to add.The reason why we want to do this is because we are not that familiar with data science but we want to add it on as part of the curriculum so your contribution is highly required for this section.Just make sure that when you include this it should cater for total begginers.


Game development
=================

Just raise an issue if you want to contribute to this.We will get back to you as soon as possible.We highly value for effort to contribute.
