.. _InputForUsers:

==================
The input function
==================

Sometimes in basic GUI(graphical user interphase), applications,
some input from a user might be wanted. To do this, we use the
built-in input functionality with python 3. If you are familiar with Python 2.7,
the python 3 input function acts like the python 2 raw_input function. 


.. code-block:: python

    x = input('What is your name?:')
    
    print(x)

Go ahead and try that in your command prompt.It should ask you what is you name? and 
when you input the answer it will be stored in ``x`` really cool haaah. So this function 
is easy to use but very very useful.
